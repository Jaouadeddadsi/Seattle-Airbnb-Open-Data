# Useful information to know before investing in Airbnb in Seattle


### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to get useful information that will help the future Airbnb investor  in Seattle. In particular, the questions I interested in are :

- What are the most requested neighborhoods in Seattle?
- What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
- What should we care about to have a good Airbnb Ratings?

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### File Descriptions

- Data :  * listings.csv, including full descriptions and average review score.  *Reviews.csv, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments * Calendar.csv, including listing id and the price and availability for that day.
- Tree jupyter notebooks each one answer a question.

### Summary of results
The results of the analysis are summarised in a blog post here: [Three things you should know before investing in Airbnb in seattle](https://medium.com/@jaouadeddadsi2016/three-things-you-should-know-before-investing-in-airbnb-in-seattle-8013b25cd4e2)
